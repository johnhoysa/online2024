Build to do:
Make sure build is working as I want it to
- make sure only build files are moved, currently all files are moved
- build is not really working now that index is in root directory
     Issue is that localhost does not pick up latest changes.
     Build is being ran
- update docs to be user friendly

Site to do:
- Fix type and spacing issues
- Setup JS
- image alt tags are needed

Content to do:
- continue to create content

Vite has been added to site:
"npm run dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
"npm run build": "vite build", // build for production
"npm run preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build

currently index is located here: [/templates/index.html](http://localhost:3000/templates/index.html)
