Build to do:
Make sure build is working as I want it to
- build is not picking up new CSS files on build. I have to rebuild for new files to be seen on local host.
- update docs with step by step instructions.

Site to do:
- Design mobile header
- Set up hover style on scroll 


Content to do:
- continue to create content

Vite has been added to site:
"npm run dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
"npm run build": "vite build", // build for production
"npm run preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
