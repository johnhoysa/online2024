Steps to build and preview site:
npm i
npm run build
Within VS Code install Live Server pliugin. 
Open the index.html file with live server and away you go. 
This is a work around till I get hot reloading working.

"npm run dev": "vite", // start dev server, aliases: `vite dev`, `vite serve`
"npm run build": "vite build", // build for production
"npm run preview": "vite preview" // locally preview production build
